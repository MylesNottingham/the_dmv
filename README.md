# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

> I started by opening up all of the lib files on one side of my screen and all of the spec files on the other in tabs. Then I looked over the files to try to organize them by dependency. I started with the pair related to the least dependent class, ran RSPEC, refactored, committed once passing, moved on to the next pair.


2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?

> Just getting used to how the original developer organized things; trying to stick with their conventions.

3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

> Understanding the intentions of the original developer. Proper naming conventions helped a ton.
